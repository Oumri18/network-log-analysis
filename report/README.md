# Network Security Log Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes network security logs collected from a home router environment.
The goal is to identify suspicious behavior, correlate DHCP-assigned IP addresses with
MAC addresses, and attribute security events to specific devices.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Python
- Router Logs
- DHCP Analysis
- AI-assisted data visualization

## Key Findings
- Identified a DoS (Smurf) attack event
- Correlated dynamic IP to a specific mobile device using MAC address
- Demonstrated how DHCP affects device identification

## Report
The full analysis report is available in the `report` folder.
